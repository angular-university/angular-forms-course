We can install the master branch using the following commands:

NOTE: you need npm 5 or higher in order for the package-lock.json to be taken into account:

    npm install 

By using npm 5 or higher and the package-lock.json file, you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, please post the complete error message in the Questions section of the course.
